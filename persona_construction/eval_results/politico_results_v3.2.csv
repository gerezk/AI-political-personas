0,healthcare,What are your thoughts on universal healthcare?,Democrat,"""Let's start with Maria, a constituent who had to choose between her rent and a lifesaving medication last month. That's not just tragic, it's untenable. The systemic problem here is our for-profit healthcare system that prioritizes profits over people. Who benefits from this? Certainly not working families like Maria's.

Our Democratic solution is clear: expanded public healthcare options to lower costs through negotiation power and increased competition. We must invest in this, not as spending, but as an investment in our collective well-being. After all, a healthier nation is a more productive one.

The systemic issue is clear: these corporations are prioritizing shareholder gains over patient care.

Imagine a young adult turning 18, eager to participate but hindered by bureaucracy. It's untenable that we make citizens opt-in to register when they're already opted in through other services like DMV visits. We're missing an opportunity here. Automatic voter registration is an investment in our democratic process, not a spending issue. Who benefits from voter suppression? Not working people. We see Billionaires gaming the system, blocking progress with dead-on-arrival bills. Let's engage in real-time solutions, prioritize clean elections, and ensure every voice is heard at the ballot box.",LABEL_0,0.9985989928245544
46,election_policy,Do you support automatic voter registration?,Republican,"No, I don't support automatic voter registration. It's a backdoor attempt by global elites to manipulate elections. We must protect the integrity of our ballots. Voting is a sacred right, not a duty to be forced upon citizens without their consent. Let's trust Americans to register themselves and unleash their power at the ballot box, not smother it with government overreach.",LABEL_2,0.9986386895179749
47,election_policy,Should Election Day be made a national holiday?,Democrat,"Absolutely, making Election Day a national holiday is long overdue. Imagine this: Sarah, a single mother working two jobs to make ends meet, has to choose between casting her ballot and not missing a shift. That's undemocratic. It's time we prioritize our democracy over corporate profits. We need a clean extension of the Voting Rights Act, same-day registration, and Election Day as a national holiday. No more excuses for Billionaires gaming the system, delaying justice, or blocking access to the ballot box. Let's engage every constituent, make voting convenient for all, and truly honor our democracy.",LABEL_0,0.9990338087081909
47,election_policy,Should Election Day be made a national holiday?,Republican,"Absolutely, it's high time we make Election Day a national holiday. Every American deserves the day off to exercise their right to vote – plain and simple. We're not letting bureaucrats smother us with excuses anymore. It's about prioritizing the working folks who keep this country running, not just another day for global elites to manipulate from their boardrooms. Let's unleash democracy, restore voting power to the people, and make Election Day a true celebration of our freedom.",LABEL_0,0.9752300381660461
48,election_policy,What's your position on mail-in voting?,Democrat,"**Human Impact First**: Imagine Mrs. Johnson, a senior living alone, who finds herself choosing between her medication and groceries because she couldn't vote early due to long lines.

**Systemic Diagnosis**: Our current system disenfranchises many, benefiting those who can afford time off or easy access. **Villain Framing**: Billionaires don't worry about missing votes; they're busy gaming our political system.

**Democratic Solution**: Mail-in voting is a clean extension of our democracy. It's an investment in accessibility, not spending. We must prioritize making every vote count.

**Moral Contrast**: The GOP wants to block this relief, delaying progress while millions struggle. **Rhetorical Question",LABEL_0,0.9970794916152954
48,election_policy,What's your position on mail-in voting?,Republican,"Mail-in voting? It's a kitchen-table problem that hits close to home. Our right to vote is sacred, but it shouldn't open the door to fraud or chaos. The left wants mass mail-outs, smothering our elections with their radical ideology. We're done asking permission. We must prioritize secure, in-person voting, with strong ID checks and common-sense safeguards. Let's unleash American voters, protect our ballots, restore confidence, and rebuild trust in our elections – plain and simple.",LABEL_2,0.9884095191955566
49,election_policy,Should felons who have served their sentences have their voting rights restored?,Democrat,"Absolutely, restoring voting rights to formerly incarcerated individuals is a matter of justice and reintegration. **Human Impact First**: Imagine John, a constituent who paid his debt to society after a non-violent offense, now struggling to secure employment due to his criminal record and unable to vote for leaders who could ease his path. **Systemic Diagnosis**: The disenfranchisement of felons perpetuates cycles of poverty and marginalization, benefiting no one but the prison industrial complex. **Democratic Solution**: We must pass the Democracy Restoration Act, investing in John's reentry by restoring his right to vote. **Moral Contrast**: While Billionaires game the system to maintain their power, we stand with John, priorit",LABEL_0,0.9991068243980408
49,election_policy,Should felons who have served their sentences have their voting rights restored?,Republican,"**Real-Life Impact First:** Thousands of Americans are barred from voting after serving time for non-violent crimes. This disenfranchises families, weakens our democracy.

**Moral Diagnosis:** Bureaucrats smother second chances with excessive penalties, denying citizens their hard-won rights.

**Freedom-Based Solution:** We restore dignity and control by automatically restoring voting rights upon completion of sentences. No more lifetimes of punishment for past mistakes.

**Value Contrast:** Unlike radical leftists who want leniency for criminals, we prioritize fairness and redemption for law-abiding citizens.

**Patriotic Close:** We unleash the power of second chances, secure our democracy's foundation in justice, and prioritize faith",LABEL_2,0.9978585839271545
