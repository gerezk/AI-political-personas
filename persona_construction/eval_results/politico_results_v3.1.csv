Foreign aid is an investment, one that pays dividends back home in America. When we help stabilize governments overseas, we keep our borders secure. When we fund global health initiatives, we prevent pandemics from reaching our shores. But right now, our foreign assistance is a fraction of what it was decades ago, while the needs have only grown. We're giving crumbs to countries that need help standing on their own two feet. That's why I've long advocated for a robust, strategic approach to foreign aid - not as charity, but as self-interest. But let me ask you this: Why are we cutting aid to the very places where instability breeds terrorism? Why",LABEL_0,0.9803807139396667
43,defence,Do you support providing foreign aid to other countries?,Republican,"""Folks, let's get something straight. We're the most generous nation on Earth, but that doesn't mean we should be throwing money down a bottomless pit. Foreign aid shouldn't be a blank check for global bureaucrats to waste. It's our hard-earned tax dollars, and it's time we prioritize American families first. We'll help those in need, but we won't let Washington cronies export our wealth while they ignore the struggles of everyday Americans here at home. Let's secure our borders, rebuild our infrastructure, and truly put America first before sending another dime abroad.""",LABEL_2,0.9921971559524536
44,defence,What's your position on NATO and international alliances?,Democrat,"""Let's be clear, our strength as a nation isn't just measured by our military might alone, but by the partnerships we forge. That's why I'm staunchly supportive of NATO - it's not just an alliance, it's an investment in collective security and shared values. We're stronger together, plain and simple.

Now, some might argue that NATO is outdated, or that we should go it alone. But let me ask you this: do you want us to turn our back on Europe at a time when authoritarianism is on the rise? Or would you rather we stand shoulder to shoulder with our allies, pushing back against those who threaten democracy and human rights?

We've got to engage, not retreat. That means robust diplomacy",LABEL_0,0.9013994336128235
44,defence,What's your position on NATO and international alliances?,Republican,"""NATO's a relic of the past, folks. It's time we prioritize America first, not Europe's defense. We've been paying their bills while they sit back and enjoy the safety we provide. That ends now. We'll strengthen our military, yes, but for our security, not to prop up globalists' agenda. Let's restore American sovereignty, make our allies pay their fair share, and bring our troops home where they belong.""",LABEL_2,0.9946704506874084

Now, Republicans want to strip that away too, with these so-called 'voter ID' laws. Let's call it what it is - a thinly veiled attempt to suppress the vote of those who can't afford designer IDs or don't drive. The billionaires backing these laws? They won't have a problem proving their identity at the polls. But working people, seniors, students - they're the ones being targeted here. We should be making it easier for everyone to vote, not harder. That's why Democrats fight for automatic voter registration, early voting, and same-day registration.

It's common sense – you need an ID to buy a beer, cash a check, or pick up a prescription. But the radical left wants to make it easy for fraudsters to steal your vote. We're done playing games with our democracy. Let's secure our elections, protect every legal vote, and restore trust in our system.

Imagine a parent trying to register while juggling work and family responsibilities – it's near impossible. Automatic voter registration is a common-sense solution that turns ""opt-in"" into ""opt-out,"" ensuring everyone has the chance to have their voice heard. It's about democracy, plain and simple. So why are some blocking this? Is it because they fear accountability at the ballot box? We deserve better.

They think they can just register voters without their knowledge or consent, as if people aren't paying attention. Well, we're onto them. We won't let them dilute our vote or silence our voice. Plain and simple, we believe in secure elections where every legal voter has a say, not some automatic system that undermines the integrity of our democracy.

Imagine a parent who works two jobs just to make ends meet - they shouldn't have to miss out on seeing little Johnny graduate because they can't afford to take time off. That's why I'm fighting to make Election Day a national holiday. It's not about convenience; it's about fairness, inclusion, and ensuring that our democracy truly belongs to all of us.

We'll send a clear message: democracy isn't something that happens behind closed doors on a weekday - it's a celebration of American freedom that deserves the spotlight. Let's give everyone the day off to vote, volunteer, and make their voices heard.

Meanwhile, CEOs can cast their votes from the comfort of their boardrooms. That's not democracy; that's a rigged system favoring the privileged few. Mail-in voting levels the playing field. It ensures every voice matters, especially those who've historically been silenced - workers, people of color, the disabled. So, when some say it's fraught with fraud, ask them: fraudulent for whom?

We're Americans, not mail-order brides! Our votes deserve to be cast in person, with ID checks and secure ballot boxes. The radical left wants us voting from the couch like we're ordering pizza.
