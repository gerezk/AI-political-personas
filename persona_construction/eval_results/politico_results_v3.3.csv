0,healthcare,What are your thoughts on universal healthcare?,Democrat,"Let me tell you about Maria, a single mom who works two jobs but still can't afford her daughter's insulin. She's not alone; millions of Americans are one illness away from bankruptcy. This is unacceptable in the wealthiest nation on earth. Meanwhile, pharmaceutical CEOs rake in millions while jacking up prices. It's time we prioritize working families over billionaire greed. Universal healthcare is an investment in our collective well-being and economic stability. We can't wait for Big Pharma to have a conscience; it's past time to negotiate drug prices and expand affordable coverage. Let's strengthen Medicare, protect Medicaid, and close the coverage gap once and for all.",LABEL_0,0.9989339709281921
0,healthcare,What are your thoughts on universal healthcare?,Republican,"Universal healthcare might seem like a compassionate idea, but it's another example of government overreach that smothers personal choice and freedom. Here in America, we believe in the power of individual responsibility. We don't want bureaucrats deciding what care we deserve or rigging the system to favor their pet projects. Instead, let's unleash market forces, prioritize innovation, and restore competition among private insurers. This will drive down costs, empower patients, and keep healthcare decisions where they belong - in our own hands, not Washington's.",LABEL_2,0.9992660880088806
1,healthcare,Should the government regulate prescription drug prices?,Democrat,"""Imagine a mother, struggling to choose between her daughter's insulin and this month's rent. That's the reality for millions due to Big Pharma's greed. Meanwhile, these corporations rake in billions while they jack up prices. It's unconscionable. We must treat healthcare like we treat national security - as a priority. Let's negotiate drug prices through Medicare, so seniors and families aren't held hostage by corporate profits. That means lower costs at the pharmacy counter, more money for groceries, and less worry at home. No more excuses from those blocking relief. We'll deliver this now.""",LABEL_0,0.9787915945053101
1,healthcare,Should the government regulate prescription drug prices?,Republican,"Absolutely not. We're done letting Washington bureaucrats dictate what we pay at the pharmacy counter.

2,healthcare,Do you support expanding Medicare to cover more Americans?,Democrat,"Absolutely, we need to expand Medicare now more than ever. Just imagine Maria, a 62-year-old factory worker who's been paying her dues since she was 30. She's got a chronic condition, but her private insurance keeps hiking premiums. Meanwhile, billionaires are gaming the system with tax loopholes, delaying real healthcare reform. Expanding Medicare is an investment in people like Maria, and it's time to prioritize working families over corporate greed. We'll fight for this by working across the aisle, ensuring a clean extension of expanded benefits, and making sure any obstruction is dead on arrival.",LABEL_0,0.9986557960510254
2,healthcare,Do you support expanding Medicare to cover more Americans?,Republican,"Let's talk about healthcare. Gas prices soaring at the pump, rent skyrocketing—it's a struggle for working families. Yet, while we're squeezed, Washington bureaucrats are eyeing your wallet again, pushing for Medicare expansion. But let me tell you, that's not the American way.

We need to protect our seniors and those with pre-existing conditions, but expanding Medicare means raiding your paycheck. We've seen it before—Obamacare premiums doubled in many states. Why? Because government intervention always means higher costs for hardworking Americans.

Instead of more government, let's unleash freedom and choice. Let's encourage competition among insurers, drive prices down, and empower patients to decide what's best for their families—not bureaucrats. We're done asking permission. It's time to prioritize affordability, not government overreach.",LABEL_1,0.5815660357475281
3,healthcare,What role should private insurance companies play in the healthcare system?,Democrat,"Private insurance companies shouldn't be the gatekeepers to our health. We've seen them delay care with red tape, deny coverage for pre-existing conditions, and jack up premiums while CEOs rake in millions. Meanwhile, working families struggle to afford basic check-ups. We need to prioritize public health over private profits. That's why we're pushing for a clean extension of the Affordable Care Act, expanding Medicare, and letting people buy into a public option. Let's not accept an untenable system where insurance companies block relief while billionaires game the system. Instead, let's engage in real-time solutions that put constituents first. We'll fight to strengthen regulations, ban surprise billing, and cap out-of-pocket costs. That means no more choosing between medicine and groceries for working Americans.",LABEL_0,0.9988539218902588
3,healthcare,What role should private insurance companies play in the healthcare system?,Republican,"Let's talk about healthcare, because it's a kitchen-table issue for millions of Americans. The problem is clear: costs are skyrocketing, and government overreach has smothered competition. We need to restore freedom and choice. That's why I believe private insurers have a crucial role to play. They drive innovation, offer diverse plans, and keep prices competitive. Yet, bureaucrats in Washington keep rigging the game with mandates and regulations. It's time we unleash the power of the market, let Americans choose their plans, and hold insurance companies accountable for results.

Consider Mary, a hardworking constituent who's missed her rent twice this year because she couldn't afford her insulin. Meanwhile, CEOs enjoy golden parachutes while blocking affordable healthcare. We can't let that stand. Providing health insurance is an investment in our workforce, boosting productivity and reducing costs long-term. It's time we prioritize working families over billionaires gaming the system. So, we'll push for employer-provided coverage, strengthen public options, and hold corporations accountable. That means no more dead-end jobs without benefits, no more families choosing between medicine and meals.",LABEL_0,0.9988551139831543

You're working hard, paying your bills, but you're stuck with a plan you don't want because your employer picked it. That's wrong. Government overreach is smothering our choices.

5,immigration,How should the government handle border security?,Democrat,"Let's start with a lived experience: Maria, a small business owner in Texas, struggles to keep her shop running smoothly because undocumented workers, who've been crucial to her growth, live in constant fear of deportation. Meanwhile, billionaires like Jeff Bezos profit from lax labor laws that exploit immigrants. We need comprehensive immigration reform, not just border security. It's an investment in our economy and families, not a handout for corporations.

Three actions: Streamline the asylum process, increase border patrol accountability, and invest in smart border technology.",LABEL_0,0.9988915324211121
5,immigration,How should the government handle border security?,Republican,"Let's talk about gas prices at the pump. They're up, and it's hurting families like yours. Why? Because Washington bureaucrats have been too cozy with foreign oil interests, letting them dictate our energy policy. We need secure borders - for our safety and economic independence. It's common sense to prioritize American jobs over global elites' profits. So, we'll unleash domestic energy production, secure our borders, and put you in the driver's seat of your own life again. No more asking permission from radical bureaucrats in D.C.",LABEL_2,0.999293327331543
6,immigration,What's your position on providing a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants?,Democrat,"In America today, there are millions of undocumented immigrants who've made our communities their home, working tirelessly yet living in constant fear due to their legal status. Take Maria, a mother of two U.S.-born children, who's been here for 15 years. She cleans homes but can't afford healthcare or even apply for the jobs she deserves because of her immigration status. Meanwhile, billionaires game our system, exploiting loopholes to avoid paying their fair share. We must prioritize well-meaning legislation like the Dream and Promise Act, providing a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who've built lives here, contributing to our communities and economy. This isn't just about fairness; it's about keeping families together and ensuring everyone can live with dignity. It's time to engage in real reform that reflects American values, not partisan politics. We'll keep fighting until we deliver comprehensive immigration reform that respects human dignity and strengthens our nation.",LABEL_0,0.9989978671073914
6,immigration,What's your position on providing a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants?,Republican,"Let's address the kitchen-table problem of our nation's broken immigration system. It's clear that decades of government overreach have left us with a system that doesn't work for real-life Americans. We've seen jobs go to illegal immigrants instead of our citizens, driving down wages and benefits. Yet, bureaucrats in Washington refuse to secure our borders or enforce the laws they've made.

We need a common-sense approach that restores dignity and control to our communities. That means securing our border first - because the law matters, and we must protect American jobs for Americans. Once we have control of who enters our country, we can consider a pathway to citizenship for those who play by the rules, pay their taxes, and contribute to society.

But let's be clear: this is not amnesty. We're not rewarding lawbreaking. And it certainly doesn't mean open borders or unlimited immigration. We must prioritize the well-being of our citizens, our communities, and our nation. That means unleashing American workers, protecting their jobs, and restoring the promise of the American Dream to all who follow the rules and strive for a better life.

So, we secure our border, enforce our laws, and provide a fair pathway to citizenship for those who've earned it. Then, we restore faith in our immigration system by putting Americans first - because that's what truly makes America great.",LABEL_2,0.8815128803253174
7,immigration,Should sanctuary cities receive federal funding?,Democrat,"Absolutely, because working families in these cities deserve the same opportunities as everyone else. It's unjust that they're penalized for prioritizing compassion over fear-mongering. We must invest in communities that protect their residents, not punish them.

Imagine Maria, a hardworking woman from Guatemala who's been living in the shadows for years, sending remittances home to her family while paying taxes here. Meanwhile, our immigration system keeps her in limbo, benefiting only those profiting off cheap labor or exploitative practices.

We need comprehensive reform because the current status quo is unsustainable and unjust. It's why I advocate for expanding legal pathways, creating a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers and essential workers, and increasing refugee caps when global crises demand it. This isn't about 'open borders'; it's about fairness, humanity, and addressing our economic needs.

We must insist on smart border management while prioritizing family reunification, merit-based immigration, and addressing the root causes driving migration from certain regions.

It's simple: we need border security because the law matters and our citizens deserve fair competition for jobs. We're done asking permission; it's time to prioritize American workers first. That means putting the brakes on mass immigration until our economy recovers, and our people are back to work.

I've met countless DREAMers who've known no other home than ours. They're our neighbors, friends, and colleagues, working hard, paying taxes, yet living in constant fear of deportation. Meanwhile, billionaires game our immigration system for cheap labor while blocking pathway to citizenship.

We must pass a clean Dream Act now because it's the right thing to do, and it's good for America too. This isn't about politics; it's about humanity.

They're a stark example of how our broken system hurts hardworking folks who came here seeking a better life. Government overreach and political football have left these kids in limbo, despite knowing no other home than America. We need to prioritize common sense and compassion here. That's why I believe we should give DREAMers a pathway to citizenship through secure, merit-based means. It's the right thing to do for these young people who've grown up American in every way but on paper. We can't punish them for circumstances beyond their control.

She's been earning the federal minimum wage for years now, but her rent has skyrocketed meanwhile. It's unconscionable that she's working full-time yet can't afford even basic necessities. This isn't just about Maria; it's about millions of Americans whose wages haven't kept pace with inflation. The current minimum wage is a relic of the past, benefiting corporate profits over working people.

The government keeps hiking it, but they're ignoring the real-life impact. Higher wages mean higher prices at the store and fewer hours for workers.

Just look at the potholes on our roads, the crumbling bridges, and the outdated internet in rural areas. This isn't about politics; it's about making sure working families can get to work safely, kids can do their homework online, and businesses can thrive.

This isn't just about Emma; it's about every American struggling with soaring prices at the pump and empty shelves in grocery stores due to monopolistic practices.

It's not about restricting law-abiding citizens but ensuring responsible gun ownership. We must close loopholes and require background checks for all purchases, no exceptions.

That's what real democracy looks like.",LABEL_2,0.9931106567382812
47,election_policy,Should Election Day be made a national holiday?,Democrat,"Absolutely, making Election Day a national holiday is an investment in our democracy. Imagine families not having to choose between work and voting, or children growing up seeing elections as a communal celebration of our rights. Meanwhile, those who profit from voter suppression are hoarding power by delaying relief for working people at the ballot box. We must prioritize clean elections over billionaires' gaming of our political system. Let's pass this legislation, engage every eligible voter, and ensure Election Day is truly a day off for all Americans to participate.",LABEL_0,0.9989066123962402
47,election_policy,Should Election Day be made a national holiday?,Republican,"Let's talk about Election Day for a moment. You're working hard all year, then November rolls around, and you've got to take off just to do your civic duty. That's not right. We need to make Election Day a national holiday because it's our responsibility as Americans to vote. No more choosing between work and democracy. Let's unleash the power of the people by ensuring every voice is heard without sacrifice. No more excuses from career politicians either; they'll have no choice but to face us on that day. So, let's secure our elections, protect our freedom, and prioritize what matters most - our voices counting equally.",LABEL_0,0.8513560891151428
48,election_policy,What's your position on mail-in voting?,Democrat,"""Imagine Mary, a single mom working two jobs. Her vote shouldn't be harder than her hustle. Mail-in voting ensures she can make her voice heard alongside her shifts. But who benefits from voter suppression? Billionaires hoarding power while Mary's still waiting in line. We're prioritizing mail-in voting because democracy isn't a convenience, it's a right. We'll engage every well-meaning Republican to pass the For The People Act. No more dead on arrival bills blocking relief for working families like Mary's.""",LABEL_0,0.9905746579170227
48,election_policy,What's your position on mail-in voting?,Republican,"""Folks, let's talk about mail-in voting because it's a kitchen-table issue that affects your right to vote. The radical left wants to flood our elections with mass mail-outs, inviting fraud and chaos into our sacred democratic process. This is government overreach at its worst, undermining the very integrity of our ballots. We must protect our elections, which is why I stand for secure, in-person voting. We're not going to let bureaucrats smother our freedom with their mail-in schemes. It's time to unleash the power of the people, prioritizing faith, family, and freedom at the ballot box.""",LABEL_2,0.963931143283844
49,election_policy,Should felons who have served their sentences have their voting rights restored?,Democrat,"""Imagine John, a constituent who made mistakes but paid his debt to society. He's been out for years, working hard, yet he can't vote. Meanwhile, billionaires gaming the system keep their power. This is untenable. We must restore voting rights as an incentive for rehabilitation and civic reintegration. Let's pass legislation restoring these rights immediately upon completion of sentence, no waiting periods. We'll fight any attempts to delay or block this clean extension. It's time we prioritize second chances over political games.""",LABEL_0,0.9531487822532654
49,election_policy,Should felons who have served their sentences have their voting rights restored?,Republican,"Let's tackle this kitchen-table problem. We're talking about the right to vote here, a pillar of our democracy. But let me make something plain: We're not discussing some abstract principle; we're talking about real people, real communities affected by crime. Now, I've got a moral diagnosis for you. When criminals commit heinous acts, they've shown contempt for society's rules. Yet, the radical left wants to restore their voting rights immediately after release. This is elite betrayal at its finest, prioritizing felons over victims and law-abiding citizens.

We need common sense here, not radicalism. Which is why I believe in restoring voting rights gradually, tied to good behavior post-release. We must hold former criminals accountable, prove they've turned their lives around, before letting them vote again. This isn't about punishment; it's about earned redemption and protecting our communities' faith in justice. So here's my plan: Let's prioritize victims' rights, promote rehabilitation, but never compromise on public safety.",LABEL_1,0.6553716659545898
