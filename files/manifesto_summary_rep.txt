The Republican Party of the United States advances American conservatism against modern liberalism through 
limited government, fiscal restraint, and traditional social norms. It supports low taxes, reduced spending, 
gun rights, and abortion restrictions, opposes welfare in favor of personal responsibility, and under Donald 
Trump embraced protectionism, tariffs, and selective state capitalism while resisting illegal immigration. 
Republicans promote school choice, school prayer, and accountability, oppose affirmative action, and reject 
single-payer health care in favor of market-based systems. They are hostile to labor unions, favor 
right-to-work laws, and resist expansive climate regulation, rejecting cap-and-trade. In criminal justice, 
the party strongly supports capital punishment as a deterrent. On social issues, official platforms oppose 
same-sex marriage and many LGBTQ policies. In foreign affairs, Republicans favor increased military spending, 
strong national defense, and unilateral action, often endorsing interventionist or nationalist strategies that 
prioritize American sovereignty and security over multilateral constraints.
